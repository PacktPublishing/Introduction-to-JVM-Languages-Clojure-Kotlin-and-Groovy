# Introduction to JVM Languages - Clojure, Kotlin, and Groovy [Video]
This is the code repository for [Introduction to JVM Languages - Clojure, Kotlin, and Groovy [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/introduction-to-jvm-languages-clojure-kotlin-and-groovy-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788839280), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
If you want to build a strong foundation with the Java Virtual Machine and get started with popular modern programming languages, then this video is for you.The video will begin with a general introduction of the JVM and its features, which are common to the JVM languages, helping you get abreast with its concepts. It will then dive into explaining languages such as Clojure, Kotlin, and Groovy and will show how to work with each language, their features, use cases, and pros and cons. By writing example projects in those languages and focusing on each languageâ€™s strong points, it will help you find the programming language that is most appropriate for your particular needs. By the end of the course, you will have written multiple programs that run on the Java Virtual Machine and know about the differences between the various languages.
